# MyCv
My first curriculum vitae webpage. This page showcases my skills as a web developer and web designer. There isn't really anything you need to add or install it's my webpage showcasing me ðŸ™ƒ

## Adding to your local Repo
If you do insist on seeing it on your Pc because you love me and the github link isn't enough grab this code and paste it into your terminal to copy my repo. `git clone https://github.com/leke15/MyCv.git`

# Opening the website
After copying the repository open the `index.html ` file which is the homepage.
## Design and general flow
The website is a one-page website so everything is on a single page but there are some pages linked to it like the works and contact pages.
## Credits 
Without these people, the Website would've been well upright terrible.
